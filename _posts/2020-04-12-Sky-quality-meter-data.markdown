All data from the observatory's weather station and sky quality meter is now [available on github here](https://github.com/dokeeffe/bh-observatory-data/tree/master/datasets). This data will be kept up to date regularly.

This also includes data from a data-logging SQM borrowed from Cork Astronomy Club in 2019.
